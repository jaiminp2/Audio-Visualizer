**Final Project Proposal - Jaimin Patel**

*Simple Digital Audio Workstation*

The software I am proposing to build for my final project is a music visualizer with some add-ons

1. Visualizing an audio track
    1. Play back audio and display the waveform live (30/60 fps)
2. Basic Playback Features
    2. Play, Pause, Stop, Fast Forward
3. Record an audio track
4. Effects + visualization for those
    4. Distortion, reverb, filters, etc (undecided so far)
    
*Background*

Music is cool
Fast Fourier Transform
JUCE library

*Timeline* 

1. Week 1
    1. Be able to playback and visualize an imported audio track
2. Week 2
    2. Be able to record an audio track using microphone
3. Week 3
    3. Toggles for effects, visualize before and after effect applied

*Stretch Goals - in no particular order*

1. VST support for effects (hard)
2. More effects (normal goal is 2 fx, stretch goal is up to 5)
3. Different types of visualization
